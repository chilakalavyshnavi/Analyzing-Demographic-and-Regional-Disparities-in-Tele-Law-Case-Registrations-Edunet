## 🔍 Overview
Access to justice is not merely a legal provision—it is a mirror of social equity. This project leverages AI-powered analytics, cloud computing, and open government data to uncover patterns in the delivery of legal aid services across India. We go beyond the numbers to spotlight underserved communities, highlight high-performing districts, and recommend data-driven interventions for equitable outreach.
